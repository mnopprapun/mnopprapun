### Hi there, I'm Marc NopprapunðŸ‘‹


I am a passionate person who loves to learn and explore new ideas. I love technology and the constant evolution that comes with it. I enjoy the challenge of learning new features to implement. I also enjoy working with others to create such projects!
<p>
I also love to travel and explore the world. I love to experience different cultures and ideas.

  Everything here is in working progress including projects.
